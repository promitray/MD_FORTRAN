# MD_FORTRAN
FORTRAN programs for molecular dyamic simulations: simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) and argon atoms with a Lenard-Jones potential.
The individual folders are for the potential energy of an SHO, the verlet algorithm for MD with a harmonic potential and the Lenard-Jones potential to simulate an inert gas such as argon.
